Build the program by adding the SA5.cpp file that you will submit for the SA5
project.  The Makefile will build a main executable if you supply an SA5.cpp 
file that includes the Node* insert(Node* root, int val) routine described in
the SA5 project.

Once you build the main executable, you can run it and a blank window will
open.  Enter integers followed by <enter> and the program will call the insert
routine followed by displaying the AVL tree that is created.
